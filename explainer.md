# Screen Enumeration / Window Placement

## Abstract

As it becomes more common to use more than one monitor, it becomes more important to give Web developers the tools to make their applications perform well across multiple displays.

The Window Placement API allows developers to configure the placement of one or more browser windows across one or more screens. Placement encompasses the position and size of the window, in addition to more complex behavior around dragging, aligning, and resizing windows.

The Screen Enumeration API gives developers access to a list of the available screens and the display properties of each screen. It provides the foundation for some Window Placement APIs and can be used to enhance others.
